                <p>
                    I am a full-stack PHP developer specializing in the Laravel framework, with strong experience in building dynamic, modern web applications using Vue.js and Inertia.js. My focus is on creating responsive, user-friendly interfaces and robust backend systems that work seamlessly together through the Inertia stack.
                </p>

                <p>
                    On the backend, I work extensively with Laravel’s features including Eloquent ORM, Blade templating, route and middleware systems, RESTful API development, and authentication tools such as Laravel Breeze and Jetstream. I’m confident working with relational databases like MySQL, and I design efficient, scalable database structures using Laravel migrations and seeders.
                </p>

                <p>
                    On the frontend, I develop interactive interfaces using Vue 3 and the Composition API, often styled with Tailwind CSS. I use Inertia.js to create seamless single-page applications (SPAs) without the need for a separate API layer, which helps streamline the development process and improve performance.
                </p>

                <p>
                    I regularly work with version control systems like Git and manage projects using modern tools and workflows. I value clean, maintainable code and follow best practices in both backend and frontend development. I enjoy collaborating in team environments but am also confident managing solo projects from start to finish.
